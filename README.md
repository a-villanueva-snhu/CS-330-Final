This is the final project for CS-330 Computer Graphics. It is intended to show competence in the creation of detailed virutal 3D scenes, including navigation, object creation, texture rendering and lighting.

As always, organization and a methodical approach helped guide this project. From the initial state of getting a simple textured primitive to creating the mouse and keyboard input managmenet and camera movement system to getting complex lighting working in the final scene - constant debugging and employment of key programming ideas like encapsulation and frequent testing allowed me to effectively implement the scene piece by piece. This also made debugging fairly straight forward, with one exception - the lighting configuration in the fragment shader expected four lights, but my scene only used two, which presented a rendering glitch until the shader code was changed. 

This was my first time successfully working with OpenGL and shaders, and I think it looks fairly good. Moving forward, I feel much more comfortable using OpenGL in my projects, and have a deeper understanding of how computer graphics work and what engines like Godot and Unreal are doing behind their user-friendly coat of armor.
